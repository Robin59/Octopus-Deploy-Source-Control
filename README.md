# Octopus-Deploy-Source-Control
Simple tool to help you source control your Octopus deploy projects.
I've been using Octopus Deploy at work and it's overall a great tool. But there's one thing that really got on my nerve, the lack of native source control.
So I've decide to create a small script on my free time. It won't be perfect, just partially resolve the problem until the company behind Octopus resolve the problem.
